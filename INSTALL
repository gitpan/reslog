Installation Instruction

    Well, reslog doesn't need installation. :p  Just run it.

    Okay, okay.  In case that you can't get a good sleep without proper
installation, here is the instruction.  Notice that you can completely
ignore this.  Just run it.

    Starting from version 3, reslog uses standard Perl installation with
ExtUtils::MakeMaker.  Follow these steps:

  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make
  % make test
  % make install

    When running "make install", make sure you have the priviledge to write
to the instalation location.  This usually requires the root priviledge.

    If you are using ActivePerl under MSWin32, you should use nmake instead
of make.  nmake can be obtained from the Microsoft FTP site:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe

    If you want to install into another location, you can set the PREFIX.
For example, to install into your home when you are not root:

  % perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/jessica

    Refer to the docuemntation of ExtUtils::MakeMaker for more installation
options (by running "perldoc ExtUtils::MakeMaker").

    If you are upgrading from reslog.pl version 3.02 or earlier, please read
UPGRADE for some upgrade instruction.

    You need to have at least Perl 5.8.0 for this version of reslog.  This
is due to the ithread threading support that's only available from Perl
5.8.0.  You can always install/upgrade your perl to the newest version from
then Perl website http://www.perl.com/.  If you are using MSWin32, you can
download and install a free copy of binary Perl from the ActiveState
Corportation: http://www.activestate.com/.

Optional Perl Modules

    You may install the following optional modules:

   1. File::MMagic

        This is used to check the file type.  If this is not available, reslog
    will try to find the file executable instead.  If that is not available,
    too, reslog will try to judge the file type by its name suffix
    (extension).  In that case reslog will not be able to check the file type
    when reading from STDIN.  MSWin32 users can get file.exe from the GnuWin32
    home page instead: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/.  Be sure to save it
    as file.exe somewhere in your PATH.

   2. Compress::Zlib

        This is used to support read/write of gzip compressed files.  It is
    only needed when gzip compressed files are encountered.  If it is not
    available when needed, reslog will try to use the gzip executable instead.
    If that is not available, too, reslog will fail.  ActivePerl MSWin32 users
    can install this using "ppm install Compress::Zlib", or get gzip.exe from
    the gzip home page: http://www.gzip.org/.  Be sure to save it as gzip.exe
    somewhere in your PATH.

   3. Compress::Bzip2, version 2 or above

        This is used to support read/write of bzip2 compressed files.  It is
    only needed when bzip2 compressed files are encountered.  If it is not
    available when needed, reslog will try to use the bzip2 executable
    instead.  If that is not available, too, reslog will fail.  Notice that
    older versions before 2 does not work, since file I/O compression were not
    implemented yet.  ActivePerl MSWin32 does not have Compress::Bzip2 in
    their PPM deposit yet, as the time I'm writing this.  You can get bzip.exe
    from the bzip home page instead: http://www.bzip.org/.  Be sure to save it
    as bzip2.exe somewhere in your PATH.

   4. Term::ReadKey

        This is used to display the progress bar.  Without this reslog won't
    display the progress bar, but nothing else is different.  The progress bar
    is a good visual representation of what reslog is currently doing.
