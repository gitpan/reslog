* System Requirements

   1. Perl, version 5.8.0 or above.  I have not successfully run this
on earlier versions.  Please tell me if you can.  You can run
"perl -v" to see your current Perl version.  Perl is distributed
with most Unix now.  If not, or if you have an older version of Perl,
you can download and install/upgrade it from Perl website.

http://www.perl.com/

      If you are using MS-Win32, you can download and install
ActiveState ActivePerl.

http://www.activestate.com/

   2. Required Perl modules: None.

   3. Optional Perl Modules

    * File::MMagic

          This is used to check the file type.  If this is not
      available, reslog will try to find the file executable instead.
      If that is not available, too, reslog will try to judge the file
      type by its name suffix (extension).  In that case reslog will
      not be able to check the file type when reading from STDIN.
      MSWin32 users can get file.exe from the GnuWin32 home page
      instead: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/.  Be sure to save it
      as file.exe somewhere in your PATH.

    * Compress::Zlib

          This is used to support read/write of gzip compressed files.
      It is only needed when gzip compressed files are encountered.
      If it is not available when needed, reslog will try to use the
      gzip executable instead.  If that is not available, too, reslog
      will fail.  ActivePerl MSWin32 users can install this using
      "ppm install Compress::Zlib", or get gzip.exe from the gzip home
      page: http://www.gzip.org/.  Be sure to save it as gzip.exe
      somewhere in your PATH.

    * Compress::Bzip2, version 2 or above

          This is used to support read/write of bzip2 compressed
      files.  It is only needed when bzip2 compressed files are
      encountered.  If it is not available when needed, reslog will
      try to use the bzip2 executable instead.  If that is not
      available, too, reslog will fail.  Notice that older versions
      before 2 does not work, since file I/O compression were not
      implemented yet.  ActivePerl MSWin32 does not have
      Compress::Bzip2 in their PPM deposit yet, at the time I'm
      writing this.  You can get bzip.exe from the bzip home page
      instead: http://www.bzip.org/.  Be sure to save it as bzip2.exe
      somewhere in your PATH.

    * Term::ReadKey

          This is used to display the progress bar.  Without this
      reslog won't display the progress bar, but nothing else is
      different.  The progress bar is a good visual representation of
      what reslog is currently doing.

      You can always search, download and install the missing Perl
  modules from the the CPAN archieve.


* Installation Instruction

    If you are upgrading from reslog 3.10 or earlier, or if you are
upgrading from reslog.pl 3.02 or earlier, please read UPGRADE for some
upgrade instruction.

** Install with ExtUtils::MakeMaker

    reslog uses standard Perl installation with ExtUtils::MakeMaker.
Follow these steps:

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make
    % make test
    % make install

    When running make install, make sure you have the priviledge to
write to the instalation location.  This usually requires the root
priviledge.

    If you are using ActivePerl under MSWin32, you should use nmake
instead of make. nmake can be obtained from the Microsoft FTP site.

ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe

    If you want to install into another location, you can set the
PREFIX.  For example, to install into your home when you are not
root:

    % perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/jessica

    Refer to the docuemntation of ExtUtils::MakeMaker for more
installation options (by running perldoc ExtUtils::MakeMaker).


** Install with Module::Build

    You can install with Module::Build instead, if you prefer.
Follow these steps:

    % perl Build.PL
    % ./Build
    % ./Build test
    % ./Build install

    When running ./Build install, make sure you have the priviledge to
write to the instalation location.  This usually requires the root
priviledge.

    If you want to install into another location, you can set the
--prefix.  For example, to install into your home when you are not
root:

    % perl Build.PL --prefix=/home/jessica

    Refer to the docuemntation of Module::Build for more
installation options (by running perldoc Module::Build).
