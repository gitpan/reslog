reslog change log

2005-04-26	version 3.01
	Bug fix.
	 1. --suffix and --trim-suffix was not working.
	    I mistakenly put $_[0] instead of $_[1] in
	    the GetOptions() and this wasn't tested! ^^;
	    This is fixed.
	 2. Correct a typo in the documentation ("rewrite"
	    should be "rewrote").
	 3. Fixed a mistake that Changes.zh-tw was not
	    updated with Changes.zh-cn.

2005-04-26	version 3.00
	 1. README updated
	 2. HTML documentation updated.
	 3. Uploaded to CPAN.
	 4. HTML documents updated to conform to W3C Web
	    Content Accessibility Guide 1.0 Triple-A now.

2005-04-26	version 2.9901
	 1. INSTALL rewritten.
	 2. UPGRADE added.

2005-04-25
	 1. Module::Signature SIGNATURE gpg signature file
	    added.  The external gpg signature file is no
	    longer used.
	 2. Test suite added.
	 3. Many bugs fixed, thanks to the test suite.

2005-04-24	version 2.99
	This is a new object-oriented version.  I rewrote
	the whole script from an empty file.
	 1. Rewrite everything in object-oriented style.
	 2. ithread threading support is added.  With
	    threading it can check several IP at the same
	    time, dramatically reducing the time cost.
	    This requires Perl 5.7.2 ithread support.  New
	    option --num-threads is added for this.  You
	    can see the effect by running with -d -d.
	 3. Supports for running gzip executable, running
	    Compress::Bzip2, running bzip2 executable are
	    added.  This is the benefit of object-oriented
	    programming.  Log entry read/write is now done
	    through an uniformed I/O handler API.  This
	    eased the addition of new I/O handlers.
	 4. New option --trim-suffix is added to remove
	    certain file name suffix before appending our
	    suffix, so that reslog can line-up with other
	    log file post-processers.
	 5. file utility can be used instead of
	    File::MMagic if that is not available.
	 6. Term::Size is used to display the progress bar
	    under UNIX.  Under MSWin32 Win32::Console will
	    be used instead.  reslog can run without them,
	    but you won't see the progress bar.
	 7. Instead of resolving line by line, reslog now
	    collects all the IP found on all the source
	    log files first, resolve those IP altogether,
	    and replace the IP with the resolved domain
	    name in the log entries at one time.
	 8. The script and project name changed from
	    "reslog.pl" to "reslog".  A dot "." in the
	    project name is not valid everywhere, like
	    SourceForge.  "reslog" is enough for a script
	    name under UNIX.  Win32 users won't run it
	    with explorer file association anyway, and
	    there is a pl2bat to turn reslog to reslog.bat.
	 9. Installation method is changed from my own
	    Install.PL to Perl's standard
	    ExtUtils::MakeMaker.  Utilizing standard is
	    a good thing.  Perl's ExtUtils::MakeMaker is
	    more portable than GNU's autoconf.  As a
	    result, reslog is installed into /usr/bin
	    instead of /usr/sbin under UNIX.  Of course,
	    reslog don't need installation at all. :p
	10. Version number is changed from 3 digits (2.1.0)
	    to 2 digits (3.00), according to the Perl module
	    convention.
	11. ChangeLog is renamed as Changes, as what
	    ExtUtils::MakeMaker expects.

2003-01-04
	 1. File handler EOF read checks were fixed with
	    defined().

2002-11-13
         1. Long statistic lines are split for easy reading.
         2. open_src() was rewritten according to open_src()
            in arclog.pl, in order to use comression with
            gzip and bzip2 binary executables.

2002-11-12
	 1. RELEASE_NOTES was renamed as ChangeLog.
	 2. AUTHORS was added.
	 3. THANKS was added.
	 4. The option checking logic was rewritten.
	 5. Fixed several places where $WORKING_SRC was not
	    locked when created with tempfile.
	 6. Fixed several places where spaces are between
	    function name and its opening parenthesis,
	    according to perlstyle(1).
	 7. Unnecessary parenthesis after slice and catfile
	    were removed.

2002-10-28
	 1. Fixed a bug that $WORKING_RES was not locked
	    when opened.  But it is unlocked when closed.
	    On some systems (like linux) you can request
	    unlock on a filehandle that is not previous
	    locked, but on some others (like win32)
	    requesting unlock on a filehande that is not
	    previous locked will cause error.
	    $WORKING_RES doesn't really need locking at
	    all.  It is an anonymous temporary file handle,
	    that can be accessed by this same working
	    process only.  It has no risk of simultaneously
	    writing without threading, and I'm not doing
	    threading here.  I just lock it for a
	    consistent programming style.
	    (Thanks to Chen-hsiu Huang
	    <chenhsiu@gens.dhs.org> for reporting this.)

2002-09-28
	 1. File::MMagic and file are now used to check the
	    file type, in addition to the file name suffix,
	    with a more preferred order.
	 2. check_file_type() was added to check the file
	    types by either File::MMa
	 3. check_gzip() was added to check the gzip method
	    to use.
	 4. check_bzip2() was added to check the bzip2
	    method to use.

2002-09-18	version 2.1.0dev2
	SourceForge Memorial Release.  It's my first time
	to apply a project from SourceForge.  Mostly are
	corrections to the documentation.  SourceForge's
	project page is added to the available download
	source here.
	 1. reslog.pl's official home page at Tavern
	    IMACAT's was restored.
	 2. The previous version was renamed from
	    2.1.0-dev1 to 2.1.0dev1, in order to unify
	    the version number theme.
	 3. The project space at SourceForge was applied.
	    Package files are uploaded to SourceForge now.
	 4. Project virtual host at SourceForge was set up.
	 5. SourceForge was added into the documentation
	    as an official website and download source.
	 6. Documentation were corrected.  Too many places
	    were corrected.  Ignored.
	 7. HTML document was rewritten to accommodate
	    XHTML 1.1 recommendation.

2002-08-31	version 2.1.0dev1
	Rewrite after almost 1 year, to be run on the
	newly-released perl 5.8.0.
	 1. Filehandles are now saved and passed in global
	    named variables.  This is the way it should be.
	    The old way (initialize the file handles by
	    duplicate the STDIN and assign them) was just
	    not natural.  It works in perl 5.6.1, but not in
	    perl 5.8.0.  The duplicated filehandles are
	    constants, which cannot be assigned new values.
	 2. Indents are changed from 1 tab to 4 columns, to
	    accommodate the perl style guide documented in
	    perlstyle(1).  This increases the code
	    readability.
	 3. File operation error handlers are now using the
	    low-precedence logical "or", instead of "||",
	    which is recommended in perlop(1).  Excessive
	    parentheses in file operation functions are
	    removed for this.
	 4. Traditional Chinese files are now named with
	    suffix ".zh-tw" instead of ".b5".  Simplified
	    Chinese files are now named with suffix ".zh-cn"
	    instead of ".gb".  This is to accommodate
	    RFC-3066, ISO 639:1988, ISO 3166-1 for language
	    names.
	 5. PGP signatures of distribution files are added.
	 6. bzip2 distribution files are added.

2001-09-03	version 2.0.2
	 1. The bug that taking file handles as private
	    variables and modified them, was fixed.

2001-09-01	version 2.0.1
	 1. The bug that resolved cache %NAMES was not
	    global, was fixed. The resolved result can be
	    pass between multiple files now.
	 2. A bug that a hyper reference in the English
	    document was not specified as an absolute URL,
	    was fixed.

2001-06-29	version 2.0.0
	First public release.
	 1. Chinese and English standard header were added.
	 2. Getopt::Long was introduced to parse the
	    arguments, in replace of my own argument-parsing
	    routine.
	 3. File::Spec::Functions was introduced to handle
	    the pathnames.
	 4. Cwd was introduced to obtain the current working
	    directory.
	 5. autoflush from IO::Handle was introduced, to
	    autoflush STDOUT solely under debugging mode.
	 6. File::Temp was introduced to handle the
	    temporary working file. Processing is done on
	    temporary working files to reduce the time
	    occupying the source and result files.
	 7. Compress::Zlib was used to read the compressed
	    files.
	 8. rel2abs() was added to convert relative paths
	    to absolute paths.
	 9. progress_bar() was added to display current
	    status graphically.
	10. res_log() was added to loop multiple files.
	11. open_src() and save_res() to open source and
	    save result.
	12. POD documents was added.
	13. Release notes was added.
	14. Readme file was added.
	15. GNU General Public License was added.
	16. Installation guide was added.
	17. Install.PL was added in the distribution.

2001-01-21	version 1.3.1
	 1. autoflush was modified to do only under
	    debugging mode.
	 2. Simple header was changed standard header.

2001-01-07	version 1.3.0
