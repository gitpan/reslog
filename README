reslog -- Reverse-resolve IP in Apache log files

    reslog reverse-resolves IP in the Apache log files. These log files can
then be analyzed by another program, like Analog.  You can think of it as a
replacement of Apache HostNameLookups directive, in the sense that it resolves
the client IP altogether once a day.
